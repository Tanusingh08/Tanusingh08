Array Intersection

You have been given two integer arrays/list(ARR1 and ARR2) of size N and M, respectively. You need to print their intersection; 
An intersection for this problem can be defined when both the arrays/lists contain a particular value or to put it in other words, 
when there is a common value that exists in both the arrays/lists.

Sample Input 1 :
2
6
2 6 8 5 4 3
4
2 3 4 7 
2
10 10
1
10
Sample Output 1 :
2 4 3
10

Sample Input 2 :
1
4
2 6 1 2
5
1 2 3 4 2
Sample Output 2 :
2 1 2

CODE:
void intersection(int *input1, int *input2, int size1, int size2)
{
   int i,j,INT_MIN=-2147843647;
	for(i=0;i<size1;i++)
	{
		for(j=0;j<size2;j++)
		{
			if(input1[i]==input2[j])
			{
				cout<<input1[i]<<" ";
                input2[j]=INT_MIN;
                break;
			}
		}
	}
}
